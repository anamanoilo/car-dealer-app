## Overview

### Features

#### Filter page

- Fetches vehicle makes using
  [this endpoint](https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/vehicles/GetMakesForVehicleType/car?format=json).
- Displays the selector to choose for the next step
- The "Next" button is enabled only when a vehicle make and model year are selected

#### Result page

- After clicking "Next" user will be taken to a page showing a list of all the car models for the selected make and year.
- Static paths are generated for the result pages using `generateStaticParams`.
- Necessary data is fetched to pre-render these paths.

### Folder structure

| Folder/File    | Description                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/`         | Next.js app router and main root page (Filter page) |
| `app/api`      | API route handlers for server-side logic            |
| `app/result`   | Result page                                         |
| `app/fonts`    | binaries of custom fonts                            |
| `app/types/`   | TypeScript type definitions                         |
| `components/`  | contains React UI components                        |

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Implement Generating Pages for all Static Params**:

   - 1896 static params are generated by _generateStaticParams_. When all these requests are triggered, API denies access. For now only a part of static pages is generated with experimental next.config, but this issue should be addressed in the future.

2. **Error Handling**:

   - 500 errors are not handled by Next app router, custom approach should be implemented.

3. **Enhance UI**:
   - Improve the overall user interface for a more engaging and polished experience.
   - Reset CSS.
   - Focus on accessibility and ensure the design is responsive.
   - Add CSS styling for select options.
